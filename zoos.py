# You are required to enter a word that consists of x and y that denote the number of Zs and Os respectively. 
# The input word is considered similar to word zoo if 2Ã—x=y.

# Determine if the entered word is similar to word zoo.

# For example, words such as zzoooo and zzzoooooo are similar to word zoo but not the words such as zzooo and zzzooooo.

# Sample Input
# zzzoooooo
# Sample Output
# Yes
